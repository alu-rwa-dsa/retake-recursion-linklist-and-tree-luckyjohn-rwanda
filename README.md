2. Linklist

When you run the codes in terminal, you see the list of elements I have added printed. Besides, you also see the number of nodes in the list as I have added the function to count it.
To test the program with different data, you can edit the elements added in the list.



3. Tree

I created a link tree and added functionalities to search, insert, and delete data.
